Built a movie recommendation system using content-based . Leveraged NLP for feature engineering and text similarity to suggest the most relevant movies, ensuring accurate and personalized recommendations.

This project focuses on creating a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests movies similar to a given input. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), we extract key features such as genres, actors, directors, and movie descriptions to create a comprehensive understanding of each movie. The features are converted into numerical vectors, and the system calculates text similarity between movies to identify the closest matches.

Key Features:
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on their inherent attributes by comparing feature similarity.
NLP Integration: Utilizes preprocessing techniques to analyze textual data, ensuring a detailed and accurate feature set.
Text Similarity: Calculates vector distances to recommend the top 5 closest matches for a given movie.
Personalization: Ensures highly relevant recommendations by focusing on the content of the movies.
How It Works:
Extracts features like genres, actors, and movie descriptions.
Converts text into numerical vectors using NLP techniques.
Computes similarity scores to recommend the most relevant movies.
Conclusions:
This system demonstrates the effectiveness of content-based recommendation techniques in delivering personalized movie suggestions. While it is a foundational system, it can be enhanced further by integrating collaborative filtering or hybrid approaches to address cold-start issues and improve accuracy. It serves as a robust starting point for more complex recommendation models.
